This class implements a NAT (Network Address Translation) middlebox using
Pax. The NAT mediates between two networks, which we call "Outside" and "Inside",
and multiplexes TCP and UDP connections originating from Inside to Outside, and allows
Outside to participate in such connections.

                                 ---------
                                 |      [1]-- ...
               (Outside) ... ---[0] NAT [2]-- ... (Inside)
                                 |      ...
                                 |      [n]-- ...
                                 ---------

It maps TCP connections arriving on non-zero ports, onto the NAT's zero port.
It maintains a mapping of active TCP connections. It adds an entry to this mapping
whenever it receives a TCP SYN packet coming from a non-zero port; it assigns a fresh
ephemeral TCP port on its zero network port, and updates the source IP address to its
own. It then forwards the packet onto its zero port. It removes an entry when it's no
longer needed (because of a FIN-shutdown and timeout) or because an activity timer has
expired. As long as it has an entry, it maps TCP segments from non-zero to zero ports,
masquerading the client.
Currently RST packets do not cause entries to be removed. Instead, the inactivity
resulting from the connection being closed eventually triggers the removal.
UDP connections are treated in a similar manner, but any UDP packet from Inside can
cause an entry to be added where there wasn't one before.

NOTE could improve the implementation by having configurable "forwarding ports"
     that enable you to run servers on non-zero network ports.
